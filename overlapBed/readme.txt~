**overlapBed.py**

This program takes two bed files as an imput and return the peaks in file1 that overlap in at least one base with a peak in file2. 

Usage: overlapBed.py <file1.bed> <file2.bed> <output.bed>

Inut files:
file1.bed: bed format file. At least 4 fields: chromosome, start, end, score.
file2.bed: bed format file. At least 4 fields: chromosome, start, end, score.

Output file:
output.bed: bed format file. Five fields: chr, start (of peak in file1), end (of peak in file1), score (of peak in file 1), score (of overlaping peak in file2)
